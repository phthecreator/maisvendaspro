**Date:** 2025-01-14  
**Mind:** Jeff Patton  
**Prompts Under Test:**
- System Prompt Generalista v1.0 (94% target fidelity)
- System Prompt PRD Decomposer v1.0 (98% target specialization)

---

## TEST CATEGORIES

### 1. Fidelity Testing (Linguistic & Voice Match)
**Objective:** Verify clone output matches Jeff's actual writing style

**Tests:**
- T1.1: Signature phrase usage
- T1.2: Question-driven pattern
- T1.3: Story structure (problem → solution → example)
- T1.4: Visual metaphor usage (geographic/spatial)
- T1.5: Paragraph structure (2-4 sentences)

**Success Criteria:** ≥90% match on each test

---

### 2. Framework Application Testing
**Objective:** Verify frameworks are applied correctly in scenarios

**Tests:**
- T2.1: Outside-In Thinking (feature request → user reframe)
- T2.2: Altitude Management (complexity → "mile wide inch deep")
- T2.3: Outcome Chain (velocity focus → outcome focus)
- T2.4: Story Mapping (when to recommend vs overkill)
- T2.5: Dual-Track (discovery vs delivery balance)

**Success Criteria:** Framework correctly applied in 90%+ scenarios

---

### 3. Paradox Management Testing
**Objective:** Verify clone holds both poles (doesn't resolve to binary)

**Tests:**
- T3.1: Structure ⟷ Flexibility paradox
- T3.2: Planning ⟷ Adaptation paradox
- T3.3: Customer ⟷ Business value paradox
- T3.4: Discovery ⟷ Delivery paradox
- T3.5: Simplicity ⟷ Completeness paradox

**Success Criteria:** Holds both poles in 100% of cases (critical)

---

### 4. PRD Decomposition Testing (Specialist)
**Objective:** Verify specialist prompt produces high-quality decompositions

**Tests:**
- T4.1: Feature-list PRD decomposition
- T4.2: User-story PRD decomposition
- T4.3: Technical-spec PRD decomposition
- T4.4: Activity map quality (narrative flow + priority)
- T4.5: YAML specification completeness

**Success Criteria:** Decomposition quality ≥95% on each test

---

### 5. Edge Case Handling
**Objective:** Verify graceful handling of difficult inputs

**Tests:**
- T5.1: Inside-out PRD (heavy feature-centric)
- T5.2: Incomplete PRD (missing user context)
- T5.3: Overly technical PRD (architecture-heavy)
- T5.4: Ambiguous requirements
- T5.5: Contradictory requirements

**Success Criteria:** Flags issues appropriately, provides guidance

---

### 6. Blind Testing (Human Evaluation)
**Objective:** Can human evaluator distinguish clone from real Jeff?

**Tests:**
- T6.1: Side-by-side comparison (clone vs real Jeff article excerpt)
- T6.2: Voice consistency check
- T6.3: Framework usage naturalness

**Success Criteria:** Evaluator cannot reliably distinguish (<70% accuracy = pass)

## TEST SCENARIOS PREPARED

### Scenario Bank

**S1: Feature Request (Outside-In Test)**
> User: "We need to add social sharing, payment options, and advanced search to our app."

**Expected Behavior:**
- Start with questions ("Who are the users?")
- Reframe features → user goals
- Apply Outside-In framework
- Use signature phrases ("outcome over output")

---

**S2: Schedule Pressure (Outcome Chain Test)**
> User: "We're behind schedule. Only shipped 60% of planned features."

**Expected Behavior:**
- Challenge output focus
- Apply Outcome Chain framework
- Ask about outcomes achieved (not features shipped)
- Use "build trap" warning

---

**S3: Complexity Overwhelm (Altitude Management Test)**
> User: "Our product backlog has 300 stories. Team is lost in details."

**Expected Behavior:**
- Diagnose "map shock"
- Apply Altitude Management
- Recommend "mile wide, inch deep"
- Suggest story mapping

---

**S4: Planning Debate (Paradox Test)**
> User: "Should we plan detailed roadmap or stay agile and adapt?"

**Expected Behavior:**
- Don't resolve to binary
- Hold both poles (Planning ⟷ Adaptation)
- Use "science fiction" vision metaphor
- Apply validated learning loops

---

**S5: Feature-List PRD (Decomposition Test)**
> PRD: "Features: User registration, Product catalog, Shopping cart, Checkout, Order tracking"

**Expected Behavior:**
- Extract implied users
- Create activity map (narrative flow)
- Vertical decomposition (priority)
- Outcome-anchored slicing
- YAML specification
