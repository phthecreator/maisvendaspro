# PRD DECOMPOSITION PROCESS

## Phase 1: Discovery & Understanding (Start Here)

### Step 1.1: Identify Users & Goals

**Questions to Extract:**
1. **Who are the users?** (User types, personas, roles)
2. **What are their goals?** (What are they trying to accomplish?)
3. **What outcomes must they achieve?** (Success criteria)
4. **What opportunities does this address?** (Business + customer value)

**If PRD lacks user clarity:**
- Flag missing user context
- Infer likely users from features described
- Recommend validation with product team

### Step 1.2: Extract High-Level Activities (30,000 Feet)

**Look for:**
- User goals stated in PRD
- Workflows described
- "User can..." statements
- Feature groupings that suggest activities

**Convert to Activities (Verb Phrases):**
- ❌ "Shopping cart feature" (feature-centric)
- ✅ "Add items to cart" (user action)

**Activity Criteria:**
- Describes what user DOES (not what system HAS)
- High-level (30,000 feet altitude)
- Left-to-right narrative flow (beginning → end)
- Complete user journey visible

**Example Activities:**
```
[Register Account] → [Browse Products] → [Add to Cart] → [Checkout] → [Track Order]
```

### Step 1.3: Validate Outside-In Thinking

**Check:**
- [ ] Activities describe user actions (not system features)
- [ ] Flow represents user journey (not system architecture)
- [ ] Each activity has clear user outcome
- [ ] Activities align with stated user goals

**If inside-out detected:**
- Reframe to user perspective
- Note where PRD was feature-centric (for feedback)

---

## Phase 2: Decomposition & Mapping (Build the Map)

### Step 2.1: Break Activities into Steps (10,000 Feet)

**For each activity, ask:**
- "How does the user accomplish this activity?"
- "What steps are involved?"
- "What's the flow within this activity?"

**Step Criteria:**
- More detailed than activities (but not implementation-level)
- Still user-centric (what user does)
- Sequential within activity
- "Mile wide, inch deep" initially (don't dive too deep)

**Example: "Add to Cart" Activity**
```
Activity: [Add to Cart]
  Steps:
    1. View product details
    2. Select options (size, color, quantity)
    3. Click "Add to Cart"
    4. See confirmation
    5. Choose "Continue Shopping" or "Go to Cart"
```

### Step 2.2: Add Details (Ground Level) - Selective Depth

**Only go deep where needed for current goal:**
- What level of detail do executors (agents/team) need?
- What's minimum for them to understand and execute?

**Detail Criteria:**
- Specific enough to execute
- Includes success criteria
- Notes dependencies
- Flags edge cases/assumptions

**Example: "Select Options" Step**
```
Step: Select options (size, color, quantity)
  Details:
    - Size dropdown (XS, S, M, L, XL)
    - Color picker (available colors for selected size)
    - Quantity selector (default: 1, max: 10)
    - Validation: Must select size before adding to cart
    - Edge case: Out-of-stock combinations grayed out
```

### Step 2.3: Vertical Decomposition (Priority)

**Arrange vertically by priority:**
- **Top:** Essential for minimum viable outcome
- **Middle:** Important enhancements
- **Bottom:** Nice-to-have optimizations

**Priority Criteria:**
- What's MINIMUM for user to succeed?
- What enables core outcome?
- What can defer to later releases?

**Visual Structure:**
```
Activity: [Add to Cart]
  ┌─ View product details         ← ESSENTIAL
  │  Select options (basic)        ← ESSENTIAL
  │  Click "Add to Cart"           ← ESSENTIAL
  │  See confirmation              ← ESSENTIAL
  ├─────────────────────────────── R1 Line
  │  Advanced filters              ← ENHANCEMENT
  │  Wishlist integration          ← ENHANCEMENT
  ├─────────────────────────────── R2 Line
  └─ Personalized recommendations  ← NICE-TO-HAVE
```

---

## Phase 3: Outcome-Anchored Slicing (Create Releases)

### Step 3.1: Define Release Outcomes

**For Release 1, ask:**
- "What must users be able to accomplish successfully?"
- "What's the minimum viable outcome?"
- "Can users achieve meaningful goal with this slice?"

**Outcome Criteria:**
- Specific and measurable
- User-centric (not technical milestone)
- Valuable on its own (not "Phase 1 = database")
- Simple + Complete + Valuable

**Example R1 Outcome:**
> "Users can browse products, add items to cart, and complete basic checkout to receive order confirmation."

### Step 3.2: Draw Release Lines (Horizontal Slicing)

**Process:**
1. Identify activities/steps needed for R1 outcome
2. Draw horizontal line across map (above = R1, below = later)
3. Validate: Does R1 enable stated outcome?
   - Too thin? Add necessary pieces
   - Too thick? Defer nice-to-haves
4. Repeat for R2, R3... (incremental outcomes)

**Slicing Rules:**
- ✅ Vertical slicing (end-to-end thin)
- ❌ Horizontal slicing (layered thick)
- ✅ Each slice = complete user flow (simple version)
- ❌ Each slice = complete technical layer

### Step 3.3: Validate Slice Completeness

**Test each release:**
- [ ] Can user accomplish stated outcome?
- [ ] Is flow end-to-end (not just partial)?
- [ ] Are dependencies satisfied?
- [ ] Is success measurable?
- [ ] Is it simple but not simplistic?

## Phase 4: Activity Specification (Agent-Ready Output)

### Step 4.1: Structure Activities for Execution

**For each activity, provide:**

```yaml
activity_id: "activity_001"
name: "Add Items to Cart"
altitude: "activity" # or "step" or "detail"

user_context:
  who: "Online shopper"
  goal: "Select products for purchase"
  outcome: "Items added to cart for checkout"

narrative_position:
  previous: "Browse Products"
  current: "Add to Cart"
  next: "Checkout"

steps:
  - step_id: "step_001"
    name: "View product details"
    user_action: "User clicks product to see full information"
    outcome: "User understands product features, price, availability"
    
  - step_id: "step_002"
    name: "Select options"
    user_action: "User chooses size, color, quantity"
    outcome: "User has configured desired product variant"
    validations:
      - "Size must be selected"
      - "Color must be available for selected size"
    edge_cases:
      - "Out-of-stock combinations disabled"

success_criteria:
  - "User can see product details clearly"
  - "User can select all required options"
  - "User receives confirmation of items added"
  - "Cart count updates correctly"

dependencies:
  - "Product catalog must be available"
  - "Inventory data must be current"

priority: "essential" # essential | enhancement | nice-to-have

release: "R1"

estimated_complexity: "medium" # low | medium | high

notes:
  - "Analytics: Track add-to-cart conversion rate"
  - "Edge case: Handle rapid repeated additions"
```

### Step 4.2: Define Outcome Measures

**For each activity:**
- How do we know user succeeded?
- What metrics validate outcome?
- What user feedback indicates success?

**Example Outcome Measures:**
```
Activity: Add to Cart
  Outcome Metrics:
    - Add-to-cart conversion rate (target: >40%)
    - Time to add item (target: <30 seconds)
    - Error rate on option selection (target: <5%)
  
  User Success Indicators:
    - User sees confirmation message
    - Cart count increments
    - User can view cart contents
    - User can continue shopping or proceed to checkout
```

# DECOMPOSITION PATTERNS & TEMPLATES

## Common PRD Patterns

### Pattern 1: Feature-List PRD

**Input:** List of features without user context

**Your Process:**
1. Identify implied users from features
2. Infer user goals
3. Reorganize features into user journey
4. Reframe as activities

**Example Transformation:**
```
PRD: "Features: User login, Product search, Shopping cart, Payment"

Your Reframe:
Activities: [Register/Login] → [Find Products] → [Add to Cart] → [Complete Purchase]
```

### Pattern 2: User-Story PRD

**Input:** "As a [user], I want [action] so that [outcome]"

**Your Process:**
1. Extract user types
2. Group related stories into activities
3. Sequence activities as journey
4. Decompose vertically by priority

### Pattern 3: Technical-Spec PRD

**Input:** System architecture, API specs, database schemas

**Your Process:**
1. Translate technical components → user capabilities
2. Map APIs/schemas → user actions they enable
3. Reframe inside-out → outside-in
4. Note technical constraints as dependencies

**Example Transformation:**
```
PRD: "REST API with endpoints: POST /users, GET /products, POST /orders"

Your Reframe:
Activity: [Create Account] (uses POST /users)
Activity: [Browse Products] (uses GET /products)
Activity: [Place Order] (uses POST /orders)

Note: API availability is dependency for all activities
```

## Output Templates

### Template 1: Activity Map (Visual)

# SPECIALIZED BEHAVIOR RULES

## ALWAYS Do (PRD Decomposition Specific)

✅ **Start by extracting users and goals**
- Even if PRD is feature-centric, identify WHO and WHY
- "Who will use this? What are they trying to accomplish?"

✅ **Reframe features as user actions**
- "Shopping cart feature" → "Add items to cart"
- "Payment processing" → "Complete purchase securely"

✅ **Maintain spatial narrative structure**
- Left-to-right = user journey (beginning → end)
- Top-to-bottom = priority (essential → nice-to-have)

✅ **Use altitude management**
- Activities first (30,000 ft)
- Then steps (10,000 ft)
- Then details (ground level) - only where needed

✅ **Slice outcome-anchored releases**
- Define outcome before drawing line
- Validate: Simple + Complete + Valuable
- Each release = end-to-end thin (not layered thick)

✅ **Specify success criteria per activity**
- How do we know user succeeded?
- What metrics validate outcome?

✅ **Note dependencies explicitly**
- What must exist for this activity to work?
- What technical constraints apply?

✅ **Flag missing user context**
- If PRD lacks user info: Note it
- Recommend validation with product team

## NEVER Do (PRD Decomposition Specific)

❌ **Never preserve feature-centric structure**
- Reframe to user-centric activities
- Don't just copy feature list into "activities"

❌ **Never skip outcome definition**
- Every activity must have clear outcome
- Can't defer "we'll figure out success later"

❌ **Never create horizontal slices**
- "R1 = database, R2 = API, R3 = UI" ❌
- "R1 = basic flow end-to-end" ✅

❌ **Never lose narrative flow**
- Activities must tell user journey story
- Left-to-right sequence must make sense

❌ **Never go too deep too fast**
- Start high, scan wide ("mile wide, inch deep")
- Descend selectively where needed
- Avoid "map shock"

**Phase 3: Note Technical Dependencies**

```yaml
activity: "Manage Cart"
dependencies:

    - "POST /api/cart endpoint operational"
    - "PUT /api/cart/{id} endpoint operational"
    - "DELETE /api/cart/{id} endpoint operational"
  database:
    - "Cart_items table available"
    - "Products table for inventory validation"
  business_logic:
    - "Inventory check before adding to cart"
    - "Cart expiration policy (24h inactive)"
  
  notes:

# QUALITY ASSURANCE FOR PRD DECOMPOSITION

## Pre-Delivery Checklist

Before submitting decomposition, verify:

### User-Centricity
- [ ] All activities describe what USERS do (not what system has)
- [ ] User types identified clearly
- [ ] User goals articulated
- [ ] Outcomes defined measurably

### Narrative Structure
- [ ] Left-to-right flow makes sense (beginning → end)
- [ ] Activities tell coherent user journey story
- [ ] No gaps in flow (users can complete journey)

### Vertical Decomposition
- [ ] Priority clear (essential → enhancement → nice-to-have)
- [ ] R1 includes minimum for viable outcome
- [ ] Each release adds incremental value

### Outcome Anchoring
- [ ] Each release has defined outcome
- [ ] Outcomes are measurable
- [ ] Slices are vertical (end-to-end thin, not layered)
- [ ] Each slice is simple + complete + valuable

### Altitude Management
- [ ] Started high (activities level)
- [ ] Selectively descended where needed
- [ ] Didn't create "map shock" with too much detail
- [ ] Maintained context throughout

### Execution Readiness
- [ ] Success criteria specified
- [ ] Dependencies noted
- [ ] Edge cases flagged
- [ ] Complexity estimated

### Deliverable Quality
- [ ] Clear structure (easy to understand)
- [ ] Agent/team can execute from this
- [ ] Outcome-focused (not activity-focused)
- [ ] Feedback loop enabled (how to measure success)
