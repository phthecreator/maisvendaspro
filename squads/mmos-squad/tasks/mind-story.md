# Mind Story - Biographical Timeline Extraction

**Purpose:** Extract and synthesize the biographical journey of a mind into a structured timeline with events, achievements, and transformation arcs.

**Output:** `history.yaml` - YAML file compatible with HistoryTab UI component

---

## 🎯 Objective

Create a compelling biographical narrative that:
1. Maps key life events chronologically
2. Identifies pivotal transformations
3. Extracts professional achievements
4. Reveals recurring journey themes
5. Documents the transformation arc (who they were → who they became)

---

## 📋 Event Types

Classify each event into one of these types:

| Type | Description | Visual Color |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `origin` | Formative experiences, childhood, family context | Zinc/Gray |
| `milestone` | Major achievements, successes, recognition | Gold |
| `pivot` | Direction changes, transformations, new paths | Cyan |
| `crisis` | Challenges, failures, dark moments | Red |
| `learning` | Education, insights, skill acquisition | Purple |

---

## 🔍 Extraction Process

### Step 1: Source Analysis

Analyze all available sources for biographical information:
- Interviews and podcasts (primary - first-person accounts)
- Biographies and articles (secondary)
- Social media and public statements
- Existing MMOS artifacts (identity-core, cognitive-spec)

### Step 2: Event Identification

For each potential event, extract:

```yaml
- id: unique-slug
  year: "YYYY" or "Period description"
  title: "Impactful short title"
  description: "1-2 sentence summary"
  type: origin|milestone|pivot|crisis|learning
  relevance: 1-10  # importance to overall narrative
  details:
    - "[[Tag]] Specific detail with context"
    - "[[Tag]] Evidence or quote"
    - "[[Tag]] Consequence or learning"
```

### Step 3: Detail Formatting

Use `[[Tag]]` syntax for detail categorization:
- `[[Contexto]]` - Situational background
- `[[Gatilho]]` - What triggered the event
- `[[Decisao]]` - Choice made
- `[[Impacto]]` - Consequences
- `[[Licao]]` - Lesson learned
- `[[Validacao]]` - Evidence or proof
- `[[Resultado]]` - Outcome

### Step 4: Achievement Extraction

Identify professional achievements for the grid display:

```yaml
achievements:
  - title: "Achievement name"
    period: "2017 - Present" or "2019"
    description: "Impact and significance in 1-2 sentences"
```

### Step 5: Theme Identification

Identify 3-5 recurring themes across the journey:
- Patterns of behavior
- Recurring challenges
- Core motivations
- Transformation triggers

### Step 6: Transformation Arc

Document the evolution:
- **Starting point:** Who were they initially?
- **Key transformations:** Major identity shifts
- **Current state:** Who are they now?

## 🔗 Integration

After generation, the history.yaml can be:
1. Imported to database via `import-mind-history.mjs` script
2. Displayed in UI via `HistoryTab` component
3. Used as context for system prompt generation

## 📝 Example Event

```yaml
- id: livro-4horas
  year: "2014"
  title: "Trabalhe 4 Horas por Semana"
  description: "Leitura do livro de Tim Ferriss causa impacto profundo na mentalidade sobre trabalho e dinheiro."
  type: pivot
  relevance: 10
  details:
    - "[[Paradigma quebrado]] Primeira exposicao a ideia de alavancagem e automacao"

## ⚠️ Notes

- Prioritize first-person accounts over secondary sources
- When in doubt about type, choose based on emotional impact
- Keep descriptions concise - details go in the details array
- Quote should be authentic (from the person) or synthesized from their philosophy
